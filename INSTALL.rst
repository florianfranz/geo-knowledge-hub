``GEO Knowledge Hub`` depends essentially on `InvenioRDM <https://invenio-software.org/products/rdm/>`_. Please, read the instructions below in order to install ``GEO Knowledge Hub``.


Development installation
------------------------


Pre-Requirements
++++++++++++++++


- `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ 3.7+

- `nodejs <https://nodejs.org/>`_ 14.0.0+

.. note::

    On Linux Ubuntu, the Cairo library can be installed with ``apt-get``::

        sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev


.. note::

    For the development environment, you should have the Python development headers. On Linux Ubuntu, it can be installed with ``apt-get``::

        sudo apt install python3.7-dev


.. note::

    The Anaconda Python version is not currently supported by InvenioRDM. Please, for more details, refer to the section `Pre-Requirements <https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install/#pre-requirements>`_ in InvenioRDM documentation.


Clone the software repository
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Use ``git`` to clone the software repository::

    git clone https://github.com/geo-knowledge-hub/geo-knowledge-hub.git


Go to the source code folder::

    cd geo-knowledge-hub


Install the Invenio-CLI
+++++++++++++++++++++++


Via pip::

    pip install invenio-cli


Check the installed version::

    invenio-cli --version


.. note::

    You can use your favorite way to install a Python package. Please, refer to the section `Install the CLI <https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install/#install-the-cli>`_ in the InvenioRDM documentation.


.. note::

    If you want to create a new Python Virtual Environment, please, follow this instruction:

    *1.* Create a new virtual environment linked to Python 3.7::

        python3.7 -m venv venv


    **2.** Activate the new environment::

        source venv/bin/activate


    **3.** Update pip and setuptools::

        pip3 install --upgrade pip

        pip3 install --upgrade setuptools


.. note::

    We are using ``invenio-cli`` version 0.18.0.


Create Instance Configuration File
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


You will need to create a file named ``.invenio.private`` in the root of the source code repository with the following content::

    echo "[cli]" > .invenio.private
    echo "project_dir = $(pwd)" >> .invenio.private
    echo "instance_path = ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/var/instance" >> .invenio.private
    echo "services_setup = True" >> .invenio.private


Local Installation
++++++++++++++++++


We will run GEO Knowledge Hub locally and the database and other services in Docker containers.


From the GEO Knowledge Hub folder, install all the dependencies with the help of ``invenio-cli``::

    invenio-cli install --pre --development


After installing all the dependency libraries, setup the PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis and RabbitMQ containers::

    invenio-cli services setup --force


Run GEO Knowledge Hub
+++++++++++++++++++++


After installing locally and preparing the services, start GEO Knowledge Hub::

    invenio-cli run


If everything went well, you can open your browser and point to the following address::

    firefox https://localhost:5000
